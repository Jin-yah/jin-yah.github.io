        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Seems like you're a little interested in me... Well lucky you, here's some information to sate your curiositites:</p>
        <p>I'm a college student studying design and interaction</p>
        <p>Though I am studying UI/UX, I'm also interested in programming and scripting for games and applications</p>
        <p>The name "Jinyah" is commonly taken, so my username commonly contains a hyphen or underscore</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out, I always enjoy feedback on whatever I do. I'm also always down to play some league @Jinyah#love</p>
